                        <p>I am a Post-Baccalaureate with a Bachelor&apos;s degree in Psychology and a minor degree in Philosophy. I am currently a senior pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics at the University of Houston. I am involved with the High Altitude Student Payload (HASP) project, the Outreach Coordinator for the Society of Physics Students, working in collaboration with other ASUH members to renovate the observatory, a volunteer in my community and I work as a Medical Physicist&apos;s assistant. I plan to pursue a graduate degree in Medical Physics after graduation in Fall of 2017. I am looking forward to working with everyone to build a legacy.</p>

                        <p>I am a second-semester freshman Physics major at the University of Houston. I am currently on pace to graduate in the spring of 2020. I hope to go to graduate school where I will hopefully study and maybe some day teach Astrophysics. Outside of science, some of my loves include irony, humor, heartfelt friendship, basketball, rationality, eloquent books, eloquent people, stargazing, and the freedom to be an individual. Lastly, I feel astronomy brings us a clear awareness of our place in the universe and challenges us to deal more carefully with each other and with the place we call home.</p>

                        <p>I might be the only non-physics major here, but hey astronomy is for everybody. My major is Nutritional Science, minoring in biology, business foundation, and nonprofit leadership. I am a pre-dental will graduate spring 2018. I have always been fascinated by the universe, space and the stars. I always read books and watch documentaries about this subject along the philosophical and scientific aspects of it. Other than that, I&apos;m from Jordan originally and I love being well rounded and involved in different things to be able to understand and be empathetic to all people and bond over common interests as well.</p>

I wish to pursue a graduate and professional career in astrophysics and quantum mechanics, as well as study consciousness. I wouldn&apos;t be able to live without music, and even though I love all genres my favorites lean toward the heavier side of rock and alternative hip-hop (ex: System of a Down, Gorillaz.)</p>
