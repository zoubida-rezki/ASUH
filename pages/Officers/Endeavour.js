I plan to focus on Bio Nanoscience and hope to attain a Masters degree in my field. After graduating, I will work with Engineers Without Borders before finding a job in a research laboratory. I have been a part of the Astronomy Society for a year now and I am very honored to be an officer this year! I hope we can all learn about astronomy together and I look forward to seeing you at our meetings!</p>

                        <p>Hello, I&apos;m Youssef Mroue and I am currently a senior graduating spring 2019 with a BS in Mathematics and a minor in Chemistry. I really enjoy the different perspectives of analysis involved in higher level math which lead me to my career choice of Data Analysis. I am currently enrolled in an online degree specializing in Data Analysis but working with another institution does not take any of the love I have for UH. Having the opportunity to be an officer in ASUH is my first of many steps to start giving back to UH in any way I can.</p>
