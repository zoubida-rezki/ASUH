                        <p>I&apos;m Lilly Schaffer. I study Physics and Phronesis at U of H! These are my passions. For fun I enjoy going to sporting events, reading, letting loose, getting outside and looking at the stars - all in good company. UH has been my home and will be until May 2018! GO COOGS!</p>

                        <p>I am a second-semester sophomore Physics major at the University of Houston. I am currently on pace to graduate in the spring of 2020. In my year and a half of studying university level physics, I have found myself drifting toward Astro and Particle-Physics. After my undergraduate career, I aspire to study graduate level physics. Outside of science, some of my loves include irony, humor, heartfelt friendship, basketball, rationality, eloquent books, eloquent people, stargazing, and the freedom to be an individual. Lastly, I feel astronomy brings us a clear awareness of our place in the universe and challenges us to deal more carefully with each other and with the place we call home.</p>

                        <p>I am on my undergraduate path toward a Biochemical and Biophysical Sciences major and Psychology + Medicine and Society minors. Some of my passions include reading self-improvement books, volunteering at different places, such as Houston Food Bank and The Center for Hearing and Speech, and playing the violin. I am interested in the astronomical world beyond the amazing planet that we called home. Space has no boundaries, and what we have discovered is only minuscule compared to the infinite reaches of the universe. In addition, nature creates such an awestruck beauty of the cosmos. I cannot wait to explore the depth of space with ASUH.</p>

                        <p>I&apos;m Livia Garza and I&apos;m a junior completing dual degrees in Liberal Studies and Women&apos;s, Gender and Sexuality Studies. I have a deep appreciation for an education that engages with the humanities and the sciences to produce a unique, collaborative experience. I plan to go to graduate school for Library and Information Science and hopefully work within an academic institution&apos;s archives. Other than astronomy, I love 80s music, roller derby, and learning Russian. </p>

                        <p>I am a sophomore majoring in Biology and minoring in Psychology, pursuing a career in medicine. I would like to become a pediatrician or a psychiatrist in the future. During my free time, I enjoy watching Netflix and taking the occasional nap. I love watching movies, going to the park, and listening to classic rock. Looking up at the night sky is astonishing, and everyone should hae an opportunity to learn more about the universe. I am excited to see ASUH grow and I am glad to be a part of it.</p>

I am currently studying as an undergraduate student at the University of Houston to fulfill one of my favorite goals which is graduating with a degree in Engineering. Perspective is one of the things I treasure and this is one of the reasons why am I very grateful that I am can dedicate some time and energy to documenting authentic experiences with ASUH. Excited to be here with the University of Houston and their Astronomy Society to stargaze, learn, and explore the universe!</p>

I would like to eventually become a physician and/or epidemiologist. In my spare time, I enjoy going to museums, exploring the city, and (of course) looking at the night sky. I am excited for what ASUH has in store! </p>

                        <p>I am a junior majoring in the Honors Biomedical Sciences program with minors in Education, Chemistry, and Medicine & Society. Beyond academics, I spend my time volunteering in a variety of programs such as Literacy Advance of Houston or Reach Out and Read, researching at the Cancer Center, or enjoying myself through sports such as rock climbing, basketball, or fishing. Throughout my life I have developed a love for nature; astronomy serves as an opportunity for me to embrace nature in a way that no other activity has. I feel that this unique view that astronomy provides should be shared with as many people as possible, and so I am here to support this society to do just that! </p>
